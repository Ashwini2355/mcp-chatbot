# ðŸ¤– MCP Tool with LangChain + Groq

This project provides a command-line interface that uses Groqâ€™s LLaMA 3 models (via LangChain) to interact with custom tools exposed through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ What is this?

This tool allows users to query and interact with academic research data using natural language. It connects a conversational AI model to tools via **MCP**, such as:

- `search_papers`: Searches arXiv for papers on a given topic
- `extract_info`: Retrieves information about a specific paper by ID

These tools are implemented in an **MCP server**, and automatically invoked by the AI based on your input.
